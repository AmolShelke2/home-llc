      "Home.LLC has pioneered a smarter, better way to own your home by co-investing in residential real estate. Until now, the main way to access your equity was to add on more debt. We provide homeowners an alternative by converting a portion of their existing home equity to cash without monthly payments. By sharing in the gains only if the home goes up in value, we strive to align with the interests of our homeowners and win together.",
