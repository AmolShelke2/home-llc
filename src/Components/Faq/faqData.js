    question: "What is Home.LLC’s business model?",
    answer:
      "Home.LLC has pioneered a smarter, better way to own your home by co-investing in residential real estate. Until now, the main way to access your equity was to add on more debt. We provide homeowners an alternative by converting a portion of their existing home equity to cash without monthly payments. By sharing in the gains only if the home goes up in value, we strive to align with the interests of our homeowners and win together.",

          Home.LLC is not a co-owner, or owner of record on the home. Instead a
          second lien is placed on the property to solidify Home.LLC’s
          co-investment.

          When you co-invest with Home.LLC, you’re the owner on title—and you

            that risk to us.

          <li>
            <span className="font-bold">Buy Your Home Earlier:</span> The longer
            you wait to buy your home, the more money you lose in rent. Buy your
            home today with just 5% down.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span className="font-bold">Save Money When Buying:</span> Don’t

            contract on your behalf.
